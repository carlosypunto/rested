# RESTed

This is the official issues tracker for RESTed.

It also includes all the test requests and servers used to make sure RESTed works as expected.

## Issues

1. Since OAuth tokens are stored in local Core Data store, they won't work.
2. You'll need your own TSL certificates for the https test server. (server.crt & server.key)

## Updates

[2012-12-04] Please visit [RESTed pre-release site](http://www.helloresolven.com/betas/rested/) for access to pre-release & beta versions of RESTed.
