# RESTed

This is the official issues tracker for RESTed.

It also includes all the test requests and servers used to make sure RESTed works as expected.

## Issues

1. Since OAuth tokens are stored in local Core Data store, they won't work.
2. You'll need your own TSL certificates for the https test server. (server.crt & server.key)

[2012-11-09] RESTed 2.5 is reaching the end of the beta period. The beta has been updated to version 3, [available now](http://helloresolven.com/betas/RESTed-2.5-beta.zip).
