# RESTed

This is the official issues tracker for RESTed.

It also includes all the test requests and servers used to make sure RESTed works as expected.

## Issues

1. Since OAuth tokens are stored in local Core Data store, they won't work.
2. You'll need your own TSL certificates for the https test server. (server.crt & server.key)

## Updates

[2012-09-07] RESTed 2.5 is currently beta.  [Download](http://helloresolvenapps.minus.com/lbyF6WOaoIvfvf). Please consider trying it out and posting issues here on Github.  Thanks.
